# Chat-Application
Here I created a simple distributed client-server application, Where the server role is to accept the client's connection and transfer messages between clients.
To run the application provide in Linux provide python3 server.py IP Port in the command line and run the client application the same as the server. 
For Example 121.0.0.1 8888
This application works both in linux and windows as I used Multithreading with sleep of (0.01) to wait.
